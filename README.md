# NoPhysicFlappyBird
This is more of a disclaimer:
1. Yeah this is not really no physic because I did have to use a rigidbody to check for collision, but I did not use any gravity or force in any kind, all motion are handled by modifying to position of the player.
2. This also obviously need to work on something on the start page. The parallax and the spawning started even when you are not playing for the first time. If you died and restarted, it should be fine, though.
3. There are also some problem when you change the screen resolution it might affect the UI.

*I will try to work on them and update the game when possible*

One more thing
